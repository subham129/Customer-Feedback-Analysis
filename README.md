*Conclusion:

This project provided valuable insights into customer sentiment and key issues from Amazon product reviews. By applying sentiment analysis, we categorized reviews into positive, neutral, and negative, revealing that a significant portion of customer feedback was focused on product quality, shipping delays, and customer service.

The topic modeling using LDA uncovered recurring themes in both positive and negative reviews, allowing us to identify specific areas where customer satisfaction is high and where improvements are needed. Negative reviews commonly highlighted issues like poor product durability, delayed deliveries, and inadequate support for defective items, while positive reviews praised the usability and quality of certain products.

The visualizations, including sentiment distribution charts and word clouds, made it easier to understand the overall sentiment trends and key customer concerns. Based on these findings, recommendations were made to improve customer satisfaction by focusing on product quality control, optimizing shipping processes, and enhancing customer service.
